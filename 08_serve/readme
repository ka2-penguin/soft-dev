VSM: Verit, Sebastian, Maya

v0
- whatever is returned in hello_world is displayed on web browser
- whatever is printed in the function prints in the terminal
- the string in @app.route() needs to follow the localhost url

v1
- '__main__' won't be printed in terminal
- same as v0 otherwise

v2
- __name__ is a special variable that is already assigned

v3
- debug being True allows editing the function without having to physically rerun the program(only save)
- debug being False helps make sure the website isn't accidentally altered

v4
- if you print __name__ in app.py and import it, it would print out '__app__'
