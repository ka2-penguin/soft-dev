HTML file for exploring DOM event propogation using JavaScript

DISCO:
1. Use alerts to show pop ups
2. Use stopPropagation to stop subsequent events from bubbling
3. Use capture (boolean parameter) to change order of bubbling
4. You can't change the .js file from dev console

QCC: 
1. What is the default that stopDefault refer to?

Bubble/Capture: 

Bubble is when events show up on the screen according to their most nested order (order in which code is written)
Capture is when events show up on the screen according to their least nested order
