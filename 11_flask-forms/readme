two types of requests: one being a request for the box to be displayed (example) 
such as a text submition box. Also a request for an answer to be sent in said box.



What is printed in the terminal when accessing root:

What is printed in the terminal after entering a username and clicking submit query:
***DIAG: this Flask obj ***
<Flask 'app'>
***DIAG: request obj ***
<Request 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' [GET]>
***DIAG: request.args ***
ImmutableMultiDict([('username', '10'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')])

Notes: Whenever something is submitted in the box, "Waaaa hooo HAAAH" is displayed on a new
screen. Also, the url changes from http://127.0.0.1:5000/ -> http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=a&sub1=Submit
Username= phrase submitted in the box. 

When print(request.args['username']) is uncommented we get a BadRequestKeyError. (From disp_loginpage())
When print(request.args['username']) is uncommented the site runs fine. (From authenticate()) Also, 
the argument submitted now appears under the 2nd uncommented print statement. 
Even when you uncomment methods=['GET', 'POST'] and put a comma inbetween "/auth", nothing changes and it still runs.
(Works for both functions)

Object = Link, and in this case you're getting the link. 
Arguments = Whatever is submitted for username and whether or not you physically press the submit button.
Headers = Host IP, what website is used, and info about computer.
