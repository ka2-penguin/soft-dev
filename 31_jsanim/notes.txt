DISCO
1. requestAnimationFrame(drawDot) to start animation
2. cancelAnimationFrame(requestID) to end animation
3. make sure to cancelAnimationFrame before requestAnimationFrame so the button effects
won't stack

QCC
1. why does the effect stack when we click button multiple times when cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
is not in code?
