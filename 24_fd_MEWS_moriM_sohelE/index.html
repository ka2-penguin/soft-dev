                <p> Once a upon a time, some mysterious person bought Catbat. No one remembers who,
                     but from the tag, this author believes he was from somewhere in Japan. He might have had countless
                     relationships but who knows. No one even knows how old he is.
                </p>
                <p> Last year, this author decided her backpack looked too plain and decided to go 
                    looking for a keychain around the house. Sadly, most of them were too small or broken.
                </p>
                <p> Sadly, Catbat was lost the day or the day after he was officially became a ducky.
                    The other potential duckies are quivering, afraid of meeting the same fate as him
