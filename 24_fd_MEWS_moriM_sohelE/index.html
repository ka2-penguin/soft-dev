                    <p> Once a upon a time, some mysterious person bought Catbat. No one remembers who,
                        but from the tag, this author believes he was from somewhere in Japan. He might 
                        have had countless relationships but who knows. No one even knows how old he is.
                    </p>
                    <p> Last year, this author decided her backpack looked too plain and decided to go 
                        looking for a keychain around the house. Unfortunately, most of them were too
                        small or broken. She found a small, black, odd-looking creature and decided on
                        it. She eventually duckified the keychain to Catbat.
                    </p>
                    <p> Sadly, Catbat was lost the day or the day after he officially became a ducky.
                        The other ducky candidates are quivering, afraid of meeting the same fate as him.
                        But there are some rumors surrounding his disappearance. Did he fall off into an
                        abyss never to be seen again? Was he stolen? Ran away? Or maybe, he fell in love 
                        at first sight with another ducky in period 8 that day and decided to quit being 
                        a keychain...
